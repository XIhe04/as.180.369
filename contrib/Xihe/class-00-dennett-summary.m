Here is my initial summary of Dennett's article.

In this article, the author talks about some negative 
effects that counterfeit people bring to us, such as 
destroying the economy, freedom of humans, culture of 
humans, and so on. This is because powerful-corporations, 
governments, and influential individuals- may control these 
counterfeit people to  manipulate public opinion and policy, 
endangering democracy(depends on the informed consent of the 
governed, rather than on false or embellished information), 
human freedom, and so on. To be more specific, counterfeit 
people are playing the role of misleaders here, distracting us by 
providing misleading information, leaving us confused, fearful, 
and anxious, so that they can persuade us to adopt policies and 
beliefs, making us more vulnerable to manipulation, and then 
becoming passive, ignorant pawns. Another thing that we need to pay
attention to is that counterfeit people pose a more insidious threat
than nuclear weapons, as their ability to autonomously reproduce 
could lead them to a loss of control. The author stresses that it 
is important to address these negative effects before it spirals out.
However, luckily, the author  pointed out some ways that may help us
to settle these problems. First, we can learn from the method of identifying
counterfeit banknotes to distinguish between real people and counterfeit
people. For example, working with the manufacturers of mobile phones, 
computers, digital TVs, and other devices to install software that can 
interrupt any counterfeit people, but we need to get software out and put 
it into use quickly. At the same time, we could introduce new laws to 
penalize AI companies that misuse these technologies. The author contends
that while the economic potential of AI is immense, AI companies should 
share the responsibility for its ethical use.

In my opinion, everything has two sides. So, the human who invented the counterfeit
human must have done so to fulfill some need, such as helping humans perform 
repetitive tasks. In fact, after the appearance of counterfeit people, humans do 
get a lot of conveniences, such as repetitive and boring work being replaced by 
artificial intelligence. Counterfeit people can also help humans organize information
to help humans save a lot of time. However, if they are not used well or used by 
humans with bad intentions, they will have negative impacts, as mentioned in the
article, they can destroy our civilization. So I think the emergence of dummies 
as a technology, whether it is good or bad depends on what humans use them for, 
because dummies are just a tool, and there is no good or bad in the tool itself. 
Moreover, this article made me realize clearly the importance of laws and a sense 
of ethics. To be more specific, two ways to ensure that new things meet good needs 
while reducing the risks they pose are new laws and a company's own sense of ethics.
With these two in place, when companies are faced with profitable but undesirable demands, 
companies will not act due to regulatory laws, and they are not willingness to act due
to their ethical constraints.
