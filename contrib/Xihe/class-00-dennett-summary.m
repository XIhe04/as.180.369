here is my initial summary of Dennett's article.
This article talks about the negative effects that
counterfeit people bring to us, such as destroying 
the economy, freedom of humans, culture of humans, 
and so on. This is because democracy depends on the 
informed consent of the governed, rather than on false 
or embellished information (misguided). Counterfeit people
are playing the role of misleaders here, distracting us by 
providing misleading information, leaving us confused, fearful, 
and anxious, so that they can persuade us to adopt policies and 
beliefs, making us more vulnerable to manipulation, and then 
becoming passive, ignorant pawns. Furthermore, counterfeit people
might pose a more insidious threat than nuclear weapons, as their 
ability to autonomously reproduce could lead to a loss of control.
Luckily, the author also pointed out that we can learn from the method 
of identifying counterfeit banknotes to distinguish between real people
and counterfeit people. For example, working with the manufacturers of 
mobile phones, computers, digital TVs, and other devices to install software 
that can interrupt any counterfeit people, but we need to get software out and 
put it into use quickly. At the same time, we could also come up with penalties 
(like jail time) for inventing these counterfeit people, and rewards for discovering 
them.

In my opinion, everything has two sides. So, the human who invented the counterfeit
human must have done so to fulfill some need, such as helping humans to perform 
repetitive tasks.In fact, after the appearance of counterfeit people, human do get a lot of 
convenience, such as repetitive and boring work are replaced by artificial intelligence. 
Counterfeit people can also help human organize information to help human save a lot of time. 
However, if they are not used well or used by human with bad intentions, they will provide
negative impacts, as mentioned in the article, they can destroy our civilization. 
So I think the emergence of dummies as a technology, whether it is good or bad depends 
on what human use it for, because dummies are just a tool, and there is no good or 
bad in the tool itself.
