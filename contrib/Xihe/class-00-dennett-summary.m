Here is my initial summary of Dennett's article.

In this article, the author talks about some negative 
effects that counterfeit people bring to us, such as 
destroying the economy, freedom of humans, and culture of 
humans, and so on. This is because powerful-corporations, 
governments, and influential individuals- may control these 
counterfeit people to  manipulate public opinion and policy, 
endangering democracy(depends on the informed consent of the 
governed, rather than on false or embellished information), 
human freedom, and so on. To be more specific, counterfeit 
people act as misleaders, distracting us with misleading information,
leaving us confused, fearful, and anxious, so that they can persuade 
us to adopt policies and beliefs, rendering us more susceptible to 
manipulation, and then becoming passive, ignorant pawns. Another thing
that we need to pay attention to is that counterfeit people pose a more 
insidious threat than nuclear weapons, as their ability to autonomously 
reproduce could lead them to a loss of control. The author stresses that it 
is important to address these negative effects before they spiral out.
However, luckily, the author  pointed out some ways that may help us
to settle these problems. First, we can learn from the method of identifying
counterfeit banknotes to distinguish between real people and counterfeit
people. For example, collaborating with manufacturers of mobile phones, computers, 
digital TVs, and other devices to install software capable of detecting counterfeit 
people, but we need to get software out and put it into use quickly. At the same 
time, we could introduce new laws to penalize AI companies that misuse these 
technologies. The author contends that while the economic potential of AI is immense, 
AI companies should share the responsibility for its ethical use.

In my opinion, the concept of "everything having two sides" applies aptly to the
creation and deployment of artificial intelligence, including counterfeit people
or AI-powered entities. The very invention of these counterfeit humans must have 
stemmed from a genuine need within society. AI technology, in its various forms, 
has revolutionized the way we live and work. For example, it has significantly 
alleviated the burden of mundane and repetitive tasks that humans once had to 
endure. This has translated into newfound convenience, allowing individuals to 
focus on more creative and intellectually stimulating pursuits. Counterfeit people
also excel in information management. They have the capability to efficiently organize 
vast datasets, a task that could consume substantial human time and effort. In this way, 
they become valuable tools for streamlining decision-making processes and improving 
productivity. However, as your summary and Dennett's article have pointed out, the 
potential misuse of AI technology is a cause for concern. When placed in the wrong hands 
or used for nefarious purposes, counterfeit people can become instruments of deception, 
manipulation, and harm. Therefore, I think the emergence of counterfeit people as a technology, 
whether it is good or bad depends on what humans use them for, because counterfeit people are 
just a tool, and there is no good or bad in the tool itself. Moreover, this article made me 
realize clearly the importance of laws and a sense of ethics. To be more specific, two ways 
to ensure that new things meet good needs while reducing the risks they pose are new laws and a 
company's own sense of ethics. With these two in place, when companies are confronted with 
lucrative yet unethical requests, companies will not act due to regulatory laws, and they choose
not to act due to their ethical principles.
